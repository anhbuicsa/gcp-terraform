This guide explains how you can use Identity-Aware Proxy (IAP) TCP forwarding to enable administrative access to VM instances that do not have external IP addresses or do not permit direct access over the internet.
IAP TCP forwarding allows you to establish an encrypted tunnel over which you can forward SSH, RDP, and other traffic to VM instances. IAP TCP forwarding also provides you fine-grained control over which users are allowed to establish tunnels and which VM instances users are allowed to connect to.
