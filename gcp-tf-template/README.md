# gcp-tf-temp

Traditionally terraform used json key as the below. Applications and users can authenticate as a service account using generated service account keys. 
```
provider "google" {
 credentials = file("google-service-account.json")
 project = "playground-project-id"
 region = "asia-east1‚Äù
}
```
It is recommended to use Google Cloud Service Account impersonation in your Terraform code. The folder contains the guide and the template which is used widely in my company as the following:

# Change Terraform configuration
### 1. Create GCS bucket and Enable versioning for the bucket
### 2. change backend.tf file
   - [ ] Change **terraform_state_bucket** to the above bucket name
   - [ ] Change **gcp_manage_state_service_account** to the appropriate google service account which can read, write or delete the state object in GCS. Ensure that you or terraform runner has the token creator permission on gcp_manage_state_service_account.
### 3. change providers.tf file
   - [ ] Change **gcp_manage_state_service_account** to the appropriate google service account which is assigned roles provision resource. Ensure that you or terraform runner has the token creator permission on gcp_manage_state_service_account.
# Example GCP resouces
   - [ ] Create a new VPC
   - [ ] Create a new NAT router so the nodes or VMs can reach the public Internet
   - [ ] Add subnetworks to the Cloud NAT
   - [ ] Create subnet
# How to run terraform
```
